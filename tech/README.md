# Technology notes for `kafka-order-events`

These notes teach every technology this repository uses, from zero, by walking through the repository's own files. You do not need to know any of them first. Each file has the same parts: what it is, why it is here, where it appears, how it works underneath, a walkthrough of this repository's use (which quotes every relevant line of every relevant file and explains each), things to try, common mistakes, check-yourself questions, and links to the official documentation. The five `python-*` files walk through the source and test files one by one.

## The files

| File | Its role here |
| --- | --- |
| [python.md](python.md) | The language all the code is written in (3.12 and newer). |
| [python-domain.md](python-domain.md) | Every file of `src/order_events/domain/`, line by line. |
| [python-application.md](python-application.md) | Every file of `src/order_events/application/`: the use cases and ports. |
| [python-infrastructure.md](python-infrastructure.md) | Every file of `src/order_events/infrastructure/`: the Kafka adapters, settings, logging, retry and shutdown. |
| [python-interfaces.md](python-interfaces.md) | Every file of `src/order_events/interfaces/`: the four command-line programs. |
| [python-tests.md](python-tests.md) | Every test file and every test under `tests/`. |
| [apache-kafka.md](apache-kafka.md) | The message server: topics, partitions, keys, consumer groups, offsets, lag. |
| [kafka-python.md](kafka-python.md) | The library that lets the Python code talk to Kafka. |
| [json.md](json.md) | The text format of each event. |
| [logfmt.md](logfmt.md) | The shape of every log line the programs write. |
| [bash.md](bash.md) | The scripts under `scripts/` that start consumers and time a backlog. |
| [make.md](make.md) | The `Makefile`: the short commands (`make up`, `make run`, ...). |
| [docker.md](docker.md) | Runs Kafka (and the packaged programs) in containers. |
| [dockerfile.md](dockerfile.md) | The recipe that packages the programs as an image. |
| [docker-compose.md](docker-compose.md) | The file that starts the Kafka container. |
| [yaml.md](yaml.md) | The format of the compose file and the CI workflow. |
| [dotenv.md](dotenv.md) | The `.env.example` file and how settings reach the programs. |
| [toml.md](toml.md) | The format of `pyproject.toml`, where the project and its tools are configured. |
| [github-actions.md](github-actions.md) | The automatic checks that run on every push. |
| [pytest.md](pytest.md) | Runs the unit, integration and end-to-end tests. |
| [pytest-cov.md](pytest-cov.md) | Measures how much code the tests ran. |
| [ruff.md](ruff.md) | The linter and formatter. |
| [mypy.md](mypy.md) | The type checker. |
| [import-linter.md](import-linter.md) | Enforces which code layer may import which. |
| [pip-venv-and-lock-files.md](pip-venv-and-lock-files.md) | How packages are installed and pinned (pip, venv, uv). |
| [pip-audit.md](pip-audit.md) | Checks the pinned packages for known vulnerabilities. |
| [editorconfig.md](editorconfig.md) | Shared editor settings. |
| [git.md](git.md) | Git, the `.gitignore` file and the commit message convention. |
| [markdown.md](markdown.md) | The README, ARCHITECTURE and decision-record files, and Mermaid diagrams. |
| [license-and-versioning.md](license-and-versioning.md) | The MIT license, the changelog and the version number. |

## Reading order

1. The language: [python.md](python.md), then the code itself, layer by layer: [python-domain.md](python-domain.md), [python-application.md](python-application.md), [python-infrastructure.md](python-infrastructure.md), [python-interfaces.md](python-interfaces.md), [python-tests.md](python-tests.md).
2. The domain: [apache-kafka.md](apache-kafka.md), [kafka-python.md](kafka-python.md), [json.md](json.md), [logfmt.md](logfmt.md).
3. The build and run tools: [make.md](make.md), [bash.md](bash.md), [pip-venv-and-lock-files.md](pip-venv-and-lock-files.md), [toml.md](toml.md), [yaml.md](yaml.md), [dotenv.md](dotenv.md).
4. The runtime pieces: [docker.md](docker.md), [docker-compose.md](docker-compose.md), [dockerfile.md](dockerfile.md).
5. The tests and checks: [pytest.md](pytest.md), [pytest-cov.md](pytest-cov.md), [ruff.md](ruff.md), [mypy.md](mypy.md), [import-linter.md](import-linter.md), [pip-audit.md](pip-audit.md), [github-actions.md](github-actions.md), [editorconfig.md](editorconfig.md), [git.md](git.md), [markdown.md](markdown.md), [license-and-versioning.md](license-and-versioning.md).

## If you have ten minutes

Read [apache-kafka.md](apache-kafka.md) (what the project is about), [python.md](python.md) (how the code is written) and [make.md](make.md) (how to run everything).
