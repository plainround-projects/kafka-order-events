# Technology notes for `kafka-order-events`

These notes teach every technology this repository uses, from zero, by walking through the repository's own files. You do not need to know any of them first. Each file has the same nine parts: what it is, why it is here, where it appears, how it works underneath, a walkthrough of this repository's use, things to try, common mistakes, five questions, and links to the official documentation.

## The files

| File | Its role here |
| --- | --- |
| [python.md](python.md) | The language all the code is written in (3.12 and newer). |
| [apache-kafka.md](apache-kafka.md) | The message server: topics, partitions, keys, consumer groups, offsets, lag. |
| [kafka-python.md](kafka-python.md) | The library that lets the Python code talk to Kafka. |
| [json.md](json.md) | The text format of each event. |
| [logfmt.md](logfmt.md) | The shape of every log line the programs write. |
| [bash.md](bash.md) | The scripts under `scripts/` that start consumers and time a backlog. |
| [make.md](make.md) | The `Makefile`: the short commands (`make up`, `make run`, ...). |
| [docker.md](docker.md) | Runs Kafka (and the packaged programs) in containers. |
| [dockerfile.md](dockerfile.md) | The recipe that packages the programs as an image. |
| [docker-compose.md](docker-compose.md) | The file that starts the Kafka container. |
| [yaml.md](yaml.md) | The format of the compose file and the CI workflow. |
| [toml.md](toml.md) | The format of `pyproject.toml`, where the project and its tools are configured. |
| [github-actions.md](github-actions.md) | The automatic checks that run on every push. |
| [pytest.md](pytest.md) | Runs the unit, integration and end-to-end tests. |
| [pytest-cov.md](pytest-cov.md) | Measures how much code the tests ran. |
| [ruff.md](ruff.md) | The linter and formatter. |
| [mypy.md](mypy.md) | The type checker. |
| [import-linter.md](import-linter.md) | Enforces which code layer may import which. |
| [pip-venv-and-lock-files.md](pip-venv-and-lock-files.md) | How packages are installed and pinned (pip, venv, uv). |
| [pip-audit.md](pip-audit.md) | Checks the pinned packages for known vulnerabilities. |
| [editorconfig.md](editorconfig.md) | Shared editor settings. |

## Reading order

1. The language: [python.md](python.md).
2. The domain: [apache-kafka.md](apache-kafka.md), [kafka-python.md](kafka-python.md), [json.md](json.md), [logfmt.md](logfmt.md).
3. The build and run tools: [make.md](make.md), [bash.md](bash.md), [pip-venv-and-lock-files.md](pip-venv-and-lock-files.md), [toml.md](toml.md), [yaml.md](yaml.md).
4. The runtime pieces: [docker.md](docker.md), [docker-compose.md](docker-compose.md), [dockerfile.md](dockerfile.md).
5. The tests and checks: [pytest.md](pytest.md), [pytest-cov.md](pytest-cov.md), [ruff.md](ruff.md), [mypy.md](mypy.md), [import-linter.md](import-linter.md), [pip-audit.md](pip-audit.md), [github-actions.md](github-actions.md), [editorconfig.md](editorconfig.md).

## If you have ten minutes

Read [apache-kafka.md](apache-kafka.md) (what the project is about), [python.md](python.md) (how the code is written) and [make.md](make.md) (how to run everything).
