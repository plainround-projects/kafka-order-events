# License, changelog and version numbers

## What it is

Three small files and one number say who may use the code and what changed:

- A **license** is a legal text that tells other people what they may do with your code. Without one, nobody else is allowed to copy or reuse it. The **MIT license** is a short, permissive one: anyone may use, copy, change and share the code, even commercially, as long as the license text stays with it, and the author gives no warranty.
- A **changelog** is a list of changes for each released version, written for people, not machines.
- A **version number** such as `0.1.0` labels a release. **Semantic Versioning** (SemVer) gives the three numbers meaning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Raise MAJOR for a change that breaks users, MINOR for a new feature that does not break them, PATCH for a fix. Versions below `1.0.0` mean "still settling".

## Why this repository uses it

The template requires a license and a changelog in every reference repository. A learner who copies code from here knows they may, and what the terms are; and anyone can see what each version added.

## Where it appears

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `LICENSE` | The MIT license text with the author and year. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version `0.1.0` and what it added. |
| `pyproject.toml` (`version = "0.1.0"`) and `src/order_events/__init__.py` (`__version__ = "0.1.0"`) | The same version number, in the two places Python tools look. |

## How it works underneath

Nothing in the program reads these files; they are for people and for tools that scan licenses. The one rule is consistency: the number in `pyproject.toml`, the number in `__version__` and the newest heading in `CHANGELOG.md` must agree.

- Line 1 and 3: the license's name, and the copyright line: who holds the copyright and in which year.
- Line 5: the **grant**. Anyone who has a copy of the software may "deal in the Software without restriction": the listed rights (use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell) are named so nobody has to guess. "Sublicense" means pass those rights on to others.
- Line 7: the **condition**. The copyright notice and this permission text must come along with every copy or substantial part. This is the only duty the license places on users.
- Line 9: the **disclaimer**, in capitals by custom. The software is provided "as is": no promise that it works, is suitable for a purpose, or does not infringe someone else's rights, and the authors are not liable for damage from using it.

### `CHANGELOG.md`

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Single-node Kafka 4 (KRaft) in `docker-compose.yml` and the `order-events` topic: six partitions, replication factor 1, seven-day retention.
- A producer that interleaves open orders and keys every event by `orderId`, or sends unkeyed on request.
- A consumer-group member that checks every order's sequence, prints order histories and logs its partition assignment.
- Lag reading (`make lag-report`, `kafka-consumer-groups.sh`) and demos for scaling the group and draining a backlog.
- Layered package (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, `interfaces`) with the dependency rule enforced by import-linter, unit, integration and end-to-end tests, ruff, mypy, a dependency lock file and a CI workflow.
```

- Line 3 says the file follows the **Keep a Changelog** format (a convention for how to write one) and the project follows Semantic Versioning.
- Line 5: a heading per version, with the release date in year-month-day form. In brackets the version number.
- Line 7: a sub-heading names the kind of change. Keep a Changelog uses `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed` and `Security`. Version 0.1.0 is the first release, so everything is under `Added`.
- Lines 9 to 13: one bullet per notable addition, written as a sentence.

## Try it yourself

```bash
grep -n 'version' pyproject.toml | head -2
grep -n '__version__' src/order_events/__init__.py
grep -n '^## \[' CHANGELOG.md
```

Expected: `0.1.0` in all three places.

## Mistakes people make

- Copying code with no license: you have no right to reuse it, however public the file is.
- Bumping the version in one place and not the others.
- A changelog that lists every commit. Its audience wants the things a user would notice.

## Check yourself

1. What is the one condition of the MIT license? (Keep the copyright and permission notice with copies.)
2. Which number do you raise when you add a feature without breaking anyone? (MINOR.)
3. Why does `0.1.0` not promise stability? (SemVer treats versions below 1.0.0 as still changing.)
